## About Weather App
A weather app that allows you to check the current weather of your chosen location and also the 5 day forecasts.
## Reason UI/UX and code implementation is the best
Below are the reasons why my UI/UX implementation and code implementation is the best


- The UX that I implemented is easy to use for tourist. In a way that they will be able to know the current weather of their chosen location and the forecast for the next 5 days.
- The codes for both frontend and backend are readable and easy to maintain.
- I have separated the backend logic files for both location and weather wherein it will be more maintainable if there are new functionalities that will be added.  
- The error alert utilizes the use of sweetalert instead of the default alert of javascript. Wherein the sweetalert has a better design than the default alert.
- The app is responsive.
